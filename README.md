# Playing An Animation With Trigger or Key.md

This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of how to set up a simple animation and how to write code to play it through either a press of a key or when entering a trigger in the game.

## Setting Up The Animation for the Code

Every animation in Unity uses a component called **Animator**. This component is crucial because without it, the animation cannot be played or implemented into a written script. So if you haven't made an animation, you can make a simple one by going to **Windows > Animation** and the Animation panel will appear on the screen. When you click on **Create**, a window will appear where you will give the animation a name and decide where to save it in the Unity project. **Make sure you save it where you can find it again**.
